# Design Questions

How do we allocate volunteers to sponsors, and avoid double-dipping when tracking tutorials?

Do learners need to sign up, or is the only thing they need to do is request an assignment?

Special case to consider in our solution: elementary and middle school students requesting tutoring. Should we make this peer to peer, or separately defined learners and tutors?

Is the learners table completely necessary, or can we fold it into the assignments table?
Ultimately, I think it's going to be needed, because there is some parent and personal details that are required.

How to operate an environment with multiple organizers? Why can't we do just one?
